// This is obviously a very powerful pair of components. It's where Redux shines
// in all its glory. The core is hashing on a component name in a reducer.
//
// What's going on here is:
//
// 1. We're hashing on the `page` prop via the `page` reducer
// which has access to a simple hash of action types to component names. 
//
// 2. We're passing this one prop down through a <TransitionGroup /> which knows how
// to animate in and out 2 separate components via a simple declarative definition
// (for a single component at a time--NICE!).
//
// 3. We're using the same sort of technique with react-universal-component, which
// also knows how to switch components based on a hash. (Any component in the `./`
// directory is essentially hashed by its name).
//
// CONCLUSION: 
// Hashing on action types to component names gets a lot of "bang for your buck"!
// This isn't just easy. It's flexible. You haven't made any tradeoffs in capabilities.
