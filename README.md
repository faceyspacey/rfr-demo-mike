# Universal Demonstration of [Redux-First Router](https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router)

![redux-first-router-demo screenshot](./screenshot2.png)

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/faceyspacey/redux-first-router-demo
cd redux-first-router-demo
yarn
yarn start
```


## Files You Should Look At:

*universal code:*
- [***src/routesMap.js***](./src/routesMap.js) - *(observe thunks and `onBeforeChange`)*
- [***src/utils.js***](./src/utils.js) - *(check `isAllowed` function)*

*client code:*
- [***src/configureStore.js***](./src/configureStore.js) - *(nothing new here)*
- [***src/components/Switcher.js***](./src/components/Switcher.js) - *(universal component concept)*
- [***src/components/UniversalComponent.js***](./src/components/UniversalComponent.js) - ***(universal component concept continued...)***
- [***src/components/Sidebar.js***](./src/components/Sidebar.js) - *(look at the different ways to link + dispatch URL-aware actions)*
- [***src/reducers/index.js***](./src/reducers/index.js) -  *(observe simplicity of the `page` reducer. Also be cognizant of non-route action types)*


*server code:*
- [***server/index.js***](./server/index.js) - *(built-in ajax API + fake cookie handling)*
- [***server/render.js***](./server/render.js) - *(super simple thanks to [webpack-flush-chunks](https://github.com/faceyspacey/webpack-flush-chunks))*
- [***server/configureStore.js***](./server/configureStore.js) - ***(this is the gem of the repo -- observe how to filter authentication)***

## Notes
I comment throughout the code various things you can try. Look out for comments starting with *"TRY:"* and *"TASK:"*. 

For example, there are simple values like the `jwToken` you can toggle to get access to the restricted *admin* area. That showcases a key feature: ***authentication filtering.*** 

In general, this Demo is all about SSR. It shows how to use the `onBeforeChange` to properly authenticate user's and routes using *JSON Web Tokens*. And of course data-fetching via `thunks` is central to it all. There's even a real API.

Lastly, the [***server/configureStore.js***](./server/configureStore.js) file is the absolute most important file of the demo. It essentially brings your ***routing-aware Redux store*** full circle in a dead simple yet flexible manner. It works in combination with [***src/routesMap.js***](./src/routesMap.js). Study those and your redux routing dreams have come true ðŸ˜€

> As a bonus, it comes with code-splitting thanks to [react-universal-component](https://github.com/faceyspacey/react-universal-component). This setup makes splitting stupid-easy. In the future, ***routing-aware pre-fetching*** will be added to the mix, so the users never know you're only serving partial parts of your app ðŸš€


## TO DO

- auth0-based signup/login that replaces current fake cookie/JWToken setup *(PR welcome)*
